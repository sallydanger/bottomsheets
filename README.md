# Bottom Sheets
Bottom [Sheets](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sheets) refer to the rectangular menus with rounded corners which you pull up from the bottom of the screen on mobile. 

This is a Unity implementation of a BottomSheetController. To use, try the Demo scene and hit the "Show Sheet" button. From here, you can tap the sheet to toggle through preset heights, drag the sheet up and down, and swipe the sheet downwards to close.
